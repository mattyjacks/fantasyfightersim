# Fantasy Fighter Sim
An interactive RPG experience, Fantasy Fighter Sim is going to be a portfolio piece for Matt Jackson and Alex Jackson.

This is the start of something great.


# AI Content Creation:

We will use an AI art tool to create pre-generated content. For character portraits and enemies, items, towns, and more.

TO-DO: Research ai art gen tools. Find the best one, ideally free that can be run locally, or on Google Colab.

TO-DO: Generate character portraits with the following prompts: green skinned orc with battleaxe in midieval armor, tall elf with sword in leather armor, and combining an array of choices. The choices are race and armor and gender. The races are: Elf, Dwarf, Orc, Dragonborn. There are female and male options. The armor goes from leather armor to chainmail to plate to golden plate.



We will use Microsoft Azure audio content creation tools to generate the voices. We will start with pre-generated content and eventually do real time audio processing, to incorporate custom character names and town names.

# General Programming

It will run on Javascript, forming a web application.

TO-DO: Architect the software. Find tutorials on Javascript and explain why each one is needed.

Google Sheets will be used to handle the static data, such as items, enemies, and so on.

TO-DO: Figure out how to structure the github repository.

# Combat Rules

Rules follow Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition very closely. The combat is turn based.
